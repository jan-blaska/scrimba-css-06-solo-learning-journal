                    <h1>Hi there! My name is Jan Blaska and welcome to my travel blog.</h1>
                    <p>Until my early 20s I visited almost no country. I thought that traveling is for rich people and I didn´t even imagine that this may not be the true.</p>
                    <h2>How I started traveling</h2>
                    <p>It was year 2014, I was in my last year of bachelor degree university and I decided to apply for student exchange program called Erasmus. I had literaly no opinion on any city or country but I felt that some southern country would be the right fit. I was hesitating between Spain, Portugal and Turkey but for the first two mentioned, they wanted me to speak Spanish or Portuguese. So it was that, I was preparing for Turkey, specifically city Istanbul.</p>
                    <p>It was great challenge for me at the beginning because I could barely speak English. Of course, I was learning English since I was a kid but no one actually teached me to speak. Fortunately I was amongst other students from all the countries of Europe and soon after I was able to communicate with them. I could really experience how my brain become used to another language. For first three weeks I spoke only English and then It was kind of weird to hear myself speak Czech.</p>
                    <p>I was lucky to meet students who had great experiences with traveling of any kind. There were people who loved hitchhiking, others loved to jump for the road trips or some people just liked to drink and enjoy the city of Istanbul. By that time I was a big drinker :D.</p>
                    <p>Living in the foreign country and be 100% dependent on yourself (and budget from Europian Union and parents :-)) learned me a lot. I remember how I pressed the button on the washing machine for the first time or how I had to deal with contracts in English. Soon after, I just started to feel like an adult and felt really comfortable in foreign country.</p>
                    <h2>What I love about traveling</h2>
                    <p class="last-paragraph">The world is a wonderful place with so much to offer. I basically love to just go somewhere unknown and be amazed with beautiful nature, hospitality of local people or just how everything is slighly different from the things I know in my country. Exploring new places is one of the best experiences in my life.</p>
